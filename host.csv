Fiona,5/26/16,N/A,74141217,"My husband and I are British expats who have lived in Dallas for a few years and we like to introduce visitors to this city of unexpected charm.

I love travelling in the States and abroad.  Hiking and the outdoors are great joys to me and I have visited many national parks, the most recent being Joshua Tree.  We appreciate good wine and spend a lot of time in the Willamette Valley, the Pinot Noir producing region of Oregon.  For a relaxing vacation we head south to the beaches and great scuba diving of the Riviera Maya in Mexico.

When at home we like to cook and enjoy sitting out in the urban oasis that is our small, secluded back garden.  We hope you will enjoy it too!  There is a gas grill out there which you are welcome to use.

If you like reading, I have a small library in the house (I used to teach English and Drama) so please feel free to borrow a book for the duration of your stay.

We have two lovely cats (who are not permitted in the guest suite).  

Your ensuite room and attached living/dining area affords you plenty of space and privacy and we will be hands off hosts.  However, we know the local area well and are here to give information, advice and help.  Please don't hesitate to ask.

We understand you want to know a little about a potential host before you make a reservation so you will understand we want to know a little about you before we host you in our home and we reserve the right to decline room requests without explanation. Please make sure you have a picture and information about yourself on your profile before booking.

  We celebrate diversity and welcome adults over 18, regardless of nationality, race, religion or sexual orientation.  We generally cannot accommodate children under 18 as the house has 4 steep staircases with no child gates and we also have elderly cats. Nothing against children as I am a former middle and high school teacher and mentor with Big Brothers Big Sisters, but we prefer to err on the side of caution when it comes to safety and liability.  However, we will consider young adults over 16 if accompanied by a guardian over 21.  We are conveniently located for a number of colleges and we have the extra sofa bed (at least 48 hours notice required) so would be a good choice for high school students making college visits with their parents.

We do not have wheelchair access but we can make arrangements for elderly or infirm guests to access the room through the garage to avoid steps.  Please contact me in advance with special requests.

We look forward to meeting you soon!"

We live in the Dallas, Texas USA area, married 36 years, with adult children and a 6 yr old grandson, all who don't live with us which makes us ""empty-nesters"".  When we travel, we love the outdoors.  Nature trails, vistas, fresh air, mountains, water, beach, etc. We enjoy good fresh food and a great wine. We direct a 501c3 non-profit corporation which keeps us busy with ongoing communications, fund-raising, planning events, travel, meetings and projects, in addition to being professional life coaches, counselors, public speakers and writers. But we always find time to enjoy life. We are multicultural and fully bilingual (English and Spanish) and also manage well in Portuguese, Italian and French.

I love company when I am home and if the opportunity arises I would love to invite you to meet and maybe chat, watch a movie, or play with the pupo or kitties!

My family of kitties and two pups named Atlas & Riley came together over time as I have been in rescue for both dogs and cats for 15+ years. My ""Brady Bunch of Kitties"" who are all indoor fur babies now, but there are also neighborhood cats out side. My pets do NOT go into your space, unless you request a visit!!

I hope you enjoy your stay with all of us!! Please don‚Äôt hesitate to let me know if you need anything at all :)"

I have learned that while traveling the excitement for learning new things/places is important but so is rest, peace, relaxation, and comfort. 
My favorite destinations to travel to are: 1. Cancun, Hobox Island, and Playa del Carmen in Mexico.  2. Hawaii, in the United States 3. Paris in France 4. Rome, Venice, and Florence in Italy and 5. Fiji.

A Personal Message from Mike & Adriana:
We live in the Dallas, Texas USA area, married 36 years, with adult children and a 6 yr old grandson, all who don't live with us which makes us ""empty-nesters"".  When we travel, we love the outdoors.  Nature trails, vistas, fresh air, mountains, water, beach, etc. We enjoy good fresh food and a great wine. We direct a 501c3 non-profit corporation which keeps us busy with ongoing communications, fund-raising, planning events, travel, meetings and projects, in addition to being professional life coaches, counselors, public speakers and writers. But we always find time to enjoy life. We are multicultural and fully bilingual (English and Spanish) and also manage well in Portuguese, Italian and French.

When hosting, we love providing a 5-star experience in our beautiful homes with luxury linens & towels, and lots of surprise amenities. It's a real pleasure for us that people enjoy our places! 

Dallas is a great city! And our main home is only about a 12-20 minute drive from downtown, uptown, sports stadiums, music and arts venues, parks, lakes, museums, zoo, amusement parks, etc. etc. etc.! All while being able to rest and enjoy life in a quiet cul-de-sac home in an established Dallas area neighborhood surrounded by mature trees and lots of birds, to take a swim in the pool, soak in the hot tub, grill or sit around the fire pit. And inside, enjoy the great beds, fireplace in the winter as well as games, HDTV and other amenities. Life is meant to be enjoyed and we love helping people do just that.  Our other homes in southcentral Dallas near DeSoto and Lancaster. The southcentral Dallas home on one acre is ideal to rent the whole house for events like weddings and birthdays due to the layout and sitting on one fully gated acre of land with easy fast access to I-20 and I-35E. It would be our pleasure to host you at any of our Dallas area locations. "

I'm extremely thankful to everyone that has given me a chance to host them and made it a great experience. I officially started hosting in 2015 and incorporated my business as ""Amyfinehouse"" in 2018. It was an easy name to pick because it happened to be my nickname growing up because of my love for Amywinehouse. I thought this name actually fits well with what I do today. 

Today, Amyfinehouse provides uniquely designed short term rentals with upscale amenities that offer vacation and business travelers a place to stay, work, and play.

Our homes are spacious and located in walkable places, next to major city attractions or parks.

We are a small business operator that offers a personal touch, consistency, and professional customer service. There is no need to stay in a cookie-cutter hotel or short term rental from a large short term rental operator.

We provide you with a personalized guest app that offers fast self-checkin, the house manual, local recommendations, and a way to quickly make your requests and communicate with us.

We pride ourselves on going the extra mile to ensure that our customers receive the best care, customer service, and stays possible. We do so by offering a wide array of services. Our concierge services include:

‚úÖ Luggage storage
‚úÖ Grocery pickup
‚úÖ Private dinners
‚úÖ Photography & videography sessions
‚úÖ Bridal shower package
‚úÖ Baby showers
‚úÖ Romantic package

Together we love traveling, hosting, decorating, entertaining family and friends so I thought being a Airbnb host is my way to do this for a living. I'm extremely thankful to everyone that has given me a chance to host them and made it a great experience. I officially started hosting in 2015 and incorporated my business as ""Amyfinehouse"" in 2018. It was an easy name to pick because it happened to be my nickname growing up because of my love for Amywinehouse. I thought this name actually fits well with what I do today. 

Today, Amyfinehouse provides uniquely designed short term rentals with upscale amenities that offer vacation and business travelers a place to stay, work, and play.

Our homes are spacious and located in walkable places, next to major city attractions or parks.

We are a small business operator that offers a personal touch, consistency, and professional customer service. There is no need to stay in a cookie-cutter hotel or short term rental from a large short term rental operator.

We provide you with a personalized guest app that offers fast self-checkin, the house manual, local recommendations, and a way to quickly make your requests and communicate with us.

We pride ourselves on going the extra mile to ensure that our customers receive the best care, customer service, and stays possible. We do so by offering a wide array of services. Our concierge services include:

‚úÖ Luggage storage
‚úÖ Grocery pickup
‚úÖ Private dinners
‚úÖ Photography & videography sessions
‚úÖ Bridal shower package
‚úÖ Baby showers
‚úÖ Romantic package

A Personal Message from Mike & Adriana:
We live in the Dallas, Texas USA area, married 36 years, with adult children and a 6 yr old grandson, all who don't live with us which makes us ""empty-nesters"".  When we travel, we love the outdoors.  Nature trails, vistas, fresh air, mountains, water, beach, etc. We enjoy good fresh food and a great wine. We direct a 501c3 non-profit corporation which keeps us busy with ongoing communications, fund-raising, planning events, travel, meetings and projects, in addition to being professional life coaches, counselors, public speakers and writers. But we always find time to enjoy life. We are multicultural and fully bilingual (English and Spanish) and also manage well in Portuguese, Italian and French.

When hosting, we love providing a 5-star experience in our beautiful homes with luxury linens & towels, and lots of surprise amenities. It's a real pleasure for us that people enjoy our places! 

Dallas is a great city! And our main home is only about a 12-20 minute drive from downtown, uptown, sports stadiums, music and arts venues, parks, lakes, museums, zoo, amusement parks, etc. etc. etc.! All while being able to rest and enjoy life in a quiet cul-de-sac home in an established Dallas area neighborhood surrounded by mature trees and lots of birds, to take a swim in the pool, soak in the hot tub, grill or sit around the fire pit. And inside, enjoy the great beds, fireplace in the winter as well as games, HDTV and other amenities. Life is meant to be enjoyed and we love helping people do just that.  Our other homes in southcentral Dallas near DeSoto and Lancaster. The southcentral Dallas home on one acre is ideal to rent the whole house for events like weddings and birthdays due to the layout and sitting on one fully gated acre of land with easy fast access to I-20 and I-35E. It would be our pleasure to host you at any of our Dallas area locations. "

The putting green was inspired by some friends in California.  We spent hours with each other on their putting green while we talked and laughed.  Always hoped to create that same atmosphere at my home.  The gardens are a result of being trapped at home over the last year with my 90 year old mother.  Designing the landscaping, building the planters, and learning how to grow fruits and vegetables has been a welcome distraction.

We provide you with a personalized guest app that offers fast self-checkin, the house manual, local recommendations, and a way to quickly make your requests and communicate with us.

We pride ourselves on going the extra mile to ensure that our customers receive the best care, customer service, and stays possible. We do so by offering a wide array of services. Our concierge services include:

I have been a superhost with Airbnb for several years and have had the great opportunity to meet the founders and CEO of Airbnb and have a deep appreciation of the doors that Airbnb has opened in the travel world.

Working with the founders of Airbnb has been an amazing experience that I am very grateful for. I look forward to continuously contributing to such a great culture that connects people from around the world in such a unique way.  I have used my many years of travel experience to create very comfortable home away from home experiences. I am not only a superhost but a guest as well!

I grew up in New England, working in Energy I eventually found myself in Houston, Texas, over five years ago!  I am very outgoing & adventurous, love to travel, thus why I am here on AirBNB.

So in 2011 & again I 2014 I gave hosting a shot so I can meet more people traveling like myself & instantly was hooked!  Over 2 years of amazing memories of sharing time with guests from around the world and now 5 years of managing other properties. From helping with a marriage proposal, surprise birthday party with fireworks, countless meals shared along with laughter, sunrises & nightcaps with sunsets.  Now, through some fantastic friends, I have the fortune to manage a portfolio of properties in and around Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Fairfield Bay, Arkansas & Playa Del Carmen Mexico.

It‚Äôs my commitment to provide an amazing experience while making you as comfortable as possible. Whether you are here on business or pleasure, I sincerely hope you get the most of the serenity & comfort our accommodations have to offer. If there's anything I can do to make your stay more comfortable please don't hesitate to ask!  I have two mottos, ""Never A Dull Moment"" (and Airbnb ceases to amaze me, in a good way) & ""The Evening Has It's Plans For Us, We Simply Need To Arrive""

I grew up in New England, working in Energy I eventually found myself in Houston, Texas, over five years ago!  I am very outgoing & adventurous, love to travel, thus why I am here on AirBNB.

So in 2011 & again I 2014 I gave hosting a shot so I can meet more people traveling like myself & instantly was hooked!  Over 2 years of amazing memories of sharing time with guests from around the world and now 5 years of managing other properties. From helping with a marriage proposal, surprise birthday party with fireworks, countless meals shared along with laughter, sunrises & nightcaps with sunsets.  Now, through some fantastic friends, I have the fortune to manage a portfolio of properties in and around Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Fairfield Bay, Arkansas & Playa Del Carmen Mexico.

It‚Äôs my commitment to provide an amazing experience while making you as comfortable as possible. Whether you are here on business or pleasure, I sincerely hope you get the most of the serenity & comfort our accommodations have to offer. If there's anything I can do to make your stay more comfortable please don't hesitate to ask!  I have two mottos, ""Never A Dull Moment"" (and Airbnb ceases to amaze me, in a good way) & ""The Evening Has It's Plans For Us, We Simply Need To Arrive""

I officially started hosting in 2015 and incorporated my business as ""Amyfinehouse"" in 2018.

My background is in classical music performance.  As a professional cello player, I had the honor of performing at Carnegie Hall in New York City - seven times - by the time I was 25 years old. 

I spent several years working in hospitality at the Ritz-Carlton¬Æ Hotel Company, where I learned the art of customer service and exceeding expectations.

I am also a bestselling author, and I have been a teacher of excellence for the past 20 years. My passions include public speaking and empowering young people to expand their potential.

I am an avid reader, traveler and family man. 

I love traveling around the world, meeting new people, learning about other cultures and learning new things whenever possible. I look forward to having you as my guest!

I'm extremely thankful to everyone that has given me a chance to host them and made it a great experience. I officially started hosting in 2015 and incorporated my business as ""Amyfinehouse"" in 2018. It was an easy name to pick because it happened to be my nickname growing up because of my love for Amywinehouse. I thought this name actually fits well with what I do today.

AZ is one of my favorite places in the country. I graduated from the University of Arizona (BEAR DOWN) and am amazed by how much the state has grown & developed over the years. There is quite literally no shortage of things to do, places to explore and fun unique bar/restaurant concepts to choose from.

Lisa,8/8/15,within a few hours,40907479,"I grew up in Mexico City, (thus speak fluent Spanish) attended Brown University, and have lived in Dallas for 30 plus years. I greatly enjoy this thriving city. I own a small upscale medical spa, Luxury on Lovers, just minutes from this location. Guests enjoy a 20% discount on spa services (excluding medical treatments). 

I lead a very healthy lifestyle and have a great circle of friends. I have a special place in my heart for all animals and frequently rescue and foster dogs. All of my properties are pet-friendly. 

I love to cook and enjoy creating a warm, comfortable, and cozy atmosphere in my home and my spa. I believe my properties also reflect this. I love to travel, hang with my dogs, and immerse myself in a great book. 

 I have been told by all of my guests that my properties have significantly more amenities than others they have stayed at. I live just minutes away from all of them so am readily available for questions, recommendations, etc. 

I look forward to hosting you!

Grace,6/18/15,within an hour,36151189,"Mother of 3 girls and married to my ever loving husband. Together we love traveling, hosting, decorating, entertaining family and friends so I thought being a Airbnb host is my way to do this for a living. I'm extremely thankful to everyone that has given me a chance to host them and made it a great experience. I officially started hosting in 2015 and incorporated my business as ""Amyfinehouse"" in 2018. It was an easy name to pick because it happened to be my nickname growing up because of my love for Amywinehouse. I thought this name actually fits well with what I do today. 

Today, Amyfinehouse provides uniquely designed short term rentals with upscale amenities that offer vacation and business travelers a place to stay, work, and play.

Our homes are spacious and located in walkable places, next to major city attractions or parks.

We are a small business operator that offers a personal touch, consistency, and professional customer service. There is no need to stay in a cookie-cutter hotel or short term rental from a large short term rental operator.

We provide you with a personalized guest app that offers fast self-checkin, the house manual, local recommendations, and a way to quickly make your requests and communicate with us.

We pride ourselves on going the extra mile to ensure that our customers receive the best care, customer service, and stays possible. We do so by offering a wide array of services. Our concierge services include:

‚úÖ Luggage storage
‚úÖ Grocery pickup
‚úÖ Private dinners
‚úÖ Photography & videography sessions
‚úÖ Bridal shower package
‚úÖ Baby showers
‚úÖ Romantic package
‚úÖ Laundry services
‚úÖ Premium airport pickup/dropoff
‚úÖ Breakfast room service


Stay @ Amyfinehouse and you will love the experience! "

Together we love traveling, hosting, decorating, entertaining family and friends so I thought being a Airbnb host is my way to do this for a living. I'm extremely thankful to everyone that has given me a chance to host them and made it a great experience. I officially started hosting in 2015 and incorporated my business as ""Amyfinehouse"" in 2018. It was an easy name to pick because it happened to be my nickname growing up because of my love for Amywinehouse. I thought this name actually fits well with what I do today. 

Today, Amyfinehouse provides uniquely designed short term rentals with upscale amenities that offer vacation and business travelers a place to stay, work, and play.

Our homes are spacious and located in walkable places, next to major city attractions or parks.

We are a small business operator that offers a personal touch, consistency, and professional customer service. There is no need to stay in a cookie-cutter hotel or short term rental from a large short term rental operator.

We provide you with a personalized guest app that offers fast self-checkin, the house manual, local recommendations, and a way to quickly make your requests and communicate with us.

We pride ourselves on going the extra mile to ensure that our customers receive the best care, customer service, and stays possible. We do so by offering a wide array of services. Our concierge services include:

‚úÖ Luggage storage
‚úÖ Grocery pickup
‚úÖ Private dinners
‚úÖ Photography & videography sessions
‚úÖ Bridal shower package
‚úÖ Baby showers
‚úÖ Romantic package
‚úÖ Laundry services
‚úÖ Premium airport pickup/dropoff

Together we love traveling, hosting, decorating, entertaining family and friends so I thought being a Airbnb host is my way to do this for a living. I'm extremely thankful to everyone that has given me a chance to host them and made it a great experience. I officially started hosting in 2015 and incorporated my business as ""Amyfinehouse"" in 2018. It was an easy name to pick because it happened to be my nickname growing up because of my love for Amywinehouse. I thought this name actually fits well with what I do today. 

Today, Amyfinehouse provides uniquely designed short term rentals with upscale amenities that offer vacation and business travelers a place to stay, work, and play.

Our homes are spacious and located in walkable places, next to major city attractions or parks.

We are a small business operator that offers a personal touch, consistency, and professional customer service. There is no need to stay in a cookie-cutter hotel or short term rental from a large short term rental operator.

We provide you with a personalized guest app that offers fast self-checkin, the house manual, local recommendations, and a way to quickly make your requests and communicate with us.

We pride ourselves on going the extra mile to ensure that our customers receive the best care, customer service, and stays possible. We do so by offering a wide array of services. Our concierge services include:

‚úÖ Luggage storage
‚úÖ Grocery pickup
‚úÖ Private dinners
‚úÖ Photography & videography sessions
‚úÖ Bridal shower package
‚úÖ Baby showers
‚úÖ Romantic package
‚úÖ Laundry services
‚úÖ Premium airport pickup/dropoff
‚úÖ Breakfast room service

Mike & Adriana,6/10/12,within an hour,2592644,"Mike and Adriana are both PhD professionals and love hospitality and want your vacation experience or business stay to be great. To make it easy, we will help you find a property you love, offer world-class support seven days a week, and make sure our properties are clean, sanitized and ready for your stay. Even better, each home has a Guest Contact available 24/7 for anything that‚Äôs on your mind. It‚Äôs a personal touch vacation and short-term rental where your privacy is respected during your stay and hosts are available if you need them. Book one of the several locations!

A Personal Message from Mike & Adriana:
We live in the Dallas, Texas USA area, married 36 years, with adult children and a 6 yr old grandson, all who don't live with us which makes us ""empty-nesters"".  When we travel, we love the outdoors.  Nature trails, vistas, fresh air, mountains, water, beach, etc. We enjoy good fresh food and a great wine. We direct a 501c3 non-profit corporation which keeps us busy with ongoing communications, fund-raising, planning events, travel, meetings and projects, in addition to being professional life coaches, counselors, public speakers and writers. But we always find time to enjoy life. We are multicultural and fully bilingual (English and Spanish) and also manage well in Portuguese, Italian and French.

When hosting, we love providing a 5-star experience in our beautiful homes with luxury linens & towels, and lots of surprise amenities. It's a real pleasure for us that people enjoy our places! 

Dallas is a great city! And our main home is only about a 12-20 minute drive from downtown, uptown, sports stadiums, music and arts venues, parks, lakes, museums, zoo, amusement parks, etc. etc. etc.! All while being able to rest and enjoy life in a quiet cul-de-sac home in an established Dallas area neighborhood surrounded by mature trees and lots of birds, to take a swim in the pool, soak in the hot tub, grill or sit around the fire pit. And inside, enjoy the great beds, fireplace in the winter as well as games, HDTV and other amenities. Life is meant to be enjoyed and we love helping people do just that.  Our other homes in southcentral Dallas near DeSoto and Lancaster. The southcentral Dallas home on one acre is ideal to rent the whole house for events like weddings and birthdays due to the layout and sitting on one fully gated acre of land with easy fast access to I-20 and I-35E. It would be our pleasure to host you at any of our Dallas area locations. "

A Personal Message from Mike & Adriana:
We live in the Dallas, Texas USA area, married 36 years, with adult children and a 6 yr old grandson, all who don't live with us which makes us ""empty-nesters"".  When we travel, we love the outdoors.  Nature trails, vistas, fresh air, mountains, water, beach, etc. We enjoy good fresh food and a great wine. We direct a 501c3 non-profit corporation which keeps us busy with ongoing communications, fund-raising, planning events, travel, meetings and projects, in addition to being professional life coaches, counselors, public speakers and writers. But we always find time to enjoy life. We are multicultural and fully bilingual (English and Spanish) and also manage well in Portuguese, Italian and French.

When hosting, we love providing a 5-star experience in our beautiful homes with luxury linens & towels, and lots of surprise amenities. It's a real pleasure for us that people enjoy our places! 

Dallas is a great city! And our main home is only about a 12-20 minute drive from downtown, uptown, sports stadiums, music and arts venues, parks, lakes, museums, zoo, amusement parks, etc. etc. etc.! All while being able to rest and enjoy life in a quiet cul-de-sac home in an established Dallas area neighborhood surrounded by mature trees and lots of birds, to take a swim in the pool, soak in the hot tub, grill or sit around the fire pit. And inside, enjoy the great beds, fireplace in the winter as well as games, HDTV and other amenities. Life is meant to be enjoyed and we love helping people do just that.  Our other homes in southcentral Dallas near DeSoto and Lancaster. The southcentral Dallas home on one acre is ideal to rent the whole house for events like weddings and birthdays due to the layout and sitting on one fully gated acre of land with easy fast access to I-20 and I-35E. It would be our pleasure to host you at any of our Dallas area locations. "

Our favorite way to travel in Europe is to go and have no reservations and just drive the country roads until we find a town we want to learn more about. So then we check out a few places to stay and decide on one. If we really like the area, we will stay a couple nights. Sometimes having no agenda is the best type of agenda.

We have used VRBO for many years and love really experiencing other countries by living like the locals instead of just staying in a hotel. I am new to Airbnb, but excited to have another avenue for home rentals. "

I'm extremely thankful to everyone that has given me a chance to host them and made it a great experience. I officially started hosting in 2015 and incorporated my business as ""Amyfinehouse"" in 2018. It was an easy name to pick because it happened to be my nickname growing up because of my love for Amywinehouse. I thought this name actually fits well with what I do today. 

Today, Amyfinehouse provides uniquely designed short term rentals with upscale amenities that offer vacation and business travelers a place to stay, work, and play.

Our homes are spacious and located in walkable places, next to major city attractions or parks.

We are a small business operator that offers a personal touch, consistency, and professional customer service. There is no need to stay in a cookie-cutter hotel or short term rental from a large short term rental operator.

We provide you with a personalized guest app that offers fast self-checkin, the house manual, local recommendations, and a way to quickly make your requests and communicate with us.

We pride ourselves on going the extra mile to ensure that our customers receive the best care, customer service, and stays possible. We do so by offering a wide array of services. Our concierge services include:

‚úÖ Luggage storage
‚úÖ Grocery pickup
‚úÖ Private dinners
‚úÖ Photography & videography sessions
‚úÖ Bridal shower package
‚úÖ Baby showers
‚úÖ Romantic package
‚úÖ Laundry services

Sekou,7/25/13,within an hour,7725723,"In a nutshell I guess I can describe myself as a working class professional/hippie.  I tend to be very laid back and easy going 99.9% of the time, the other .1% of the time is when it comes to dealing with traffic & poor customer service at DMV.  

As for my hobbies and passions I absolutely enjoy cycling around the city or wherever in the world, running, traveling, any outdoor activities, writing, customizing bicycles, archery, blogging, cooking, career consulting, people, culture, tiramisu, baklava & Haribo Gummy Bears!!!

As you will notice from the pictures in my profile I have a map of some places I've been and other places I would like to go.  So far I've had the opportunity to travel to Germany, Canada, Japan, Central America, Mexico & I have road tripped through 36 of the 50 states, so I still have some more travels to complete.

Somethings I can't live without would probably have to be music, my bikes, great friends, good food and being away from the ocean or a body of water.

I would consider myself to be a great host only because since I've been living in DC for the past several years, most of my friends & siblings call me last minute to crash at my spot for the Presidential Inauguration, work conferences and other random reasons.  

I share a row house with 2 great housemates, my room is considered to be the master suite with recess lighting, hardwood floors, plenty of sunlight, private bathroom and exterior leading to an outside patio.  If I happen to be home during the time your traveling I like to cook for my guest and I pride myself on my cooking so you'll be in for a treat!

I have a simple creed that I live by ""Good Food, Good People & Good Libations equals Great times""   

Until the next time safe travels!
